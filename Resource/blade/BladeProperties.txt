# The lines starting with '#' is ignored.
# Structural parameters of blade


# Part I : Indicate hinge offset 'e' as in 'eR'
# HingeOffset e
0.01

# Part II : Enter different airfoil sections with their respective ending location in nondimensional form.
# Such that '1	0.4' means: 'Section 1 starts from blade root and ends at 0.4*R.
# Note that the last section's end location must be 1.0.
# Section Number , End Location
1	0.1
2	0.4
3	0.6
4	1.0

# Part III: Enter Chord Lengths at different stations nondimensionalizing with R.
# Linear interpolation will be used for given intervals. If last location is not 1, then after last station  ...
# ...chord will be kept constant.
# Station r, chord (c/R)
0.01	0.1
0.4	0.15
1.0	0.08

# Part III: Enter Twist at different stations in radians.(at each station twist is calculated as rotation from the root)
# Positive value indicates a decreased angle of attack from rotation plane
# Linear interpolation will be used for given intervals. If last location is not 1, then after last station  ...
# ...twist will be kept constant.
# Always start at root with 0.0 twist. 
# Station r, chord (c/R)
