# Part III: Enter Twist at different stations in radians.(at each station twist is calculated as rotation from the root)
# Negative value indicates a decreased angle of attack from rotation plane
# Linear interpolation will be used for given intervals. If last location is not 1, then after last station  ...
# ...twist will be kept constant.
# Always start at root with 0.0 twist. 
# Station r, twist (rad)
